# To-do-List
A To-do list is a C++ based program where you can save your wished task

# How it works
There are list of activities that will popped whenever the program have started.
So, it will ask for a prompt where you will have to choose the one to do
if you pick one(1), then you will have to add task, that is, you will state the task you want to do and put the due date which is optional. You can add unlimited number of tasks. 
Assuming you are done with one task and you want to mark it completed or even delete it, the option is there and will automatically saved into a text file Incorporated in it.
